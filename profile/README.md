# Welcome to the official GitHub page of What The FAQ.

We are a dedicated team of documenters which take other services blog posts, documention and lack of spice, and build onto it.
<p>A lot of services out there have less documentation, answered questions, PR response than you think.</p>
<br>
So we have built WTFAQ for the people with a sprinkle of spice and everything nice.
